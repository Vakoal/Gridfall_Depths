<p>This project is a text-based RPG demo set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi universe. It's a pet project I'm developing as a beginner C# programmer to practice my skills and build my portfolio.</p>
<p>The game is launched via the console and incorporates core RPG elements. In its development, I used various basic C# features, along with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>LINQ</li>
    <li>Reflection</li>
    <li>Regular Expressions</li>
    <li>JSON Serialization (for saving and loading)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Exploring diverse subterranean locations.</li>
    <li>Fighting hostile creatures and human remnants.</li>
    <li>Looting for essential supplies and gear to survive and become stronger.</li>
</ul>
